The answer: creating high-quality, stable jobs. And in today's marketplace, jobs" are in high demand  and so are the skills and the innovation and vision of entrepreneurs. In a world of high unemployment and an economy that needs new jobs to recover, who isn't hungry for a solution, something that will speed economic recovery? Many look to the government, but it's becoming more and more obvious that governments can't create real jobs. Trump and Kiyosaki believe that only one group can bring our world back to prosperity: Entrepreneurs. And, especially, entrepreneurs with the Midas Touch. This book is for people who are thinking of starting a business or who already have one and want to grow it. Midas Touch teaches how to leverage five key components that can impact success in business: Strength of character F.O.C.U.S. Brand Relationships Little things that really count.047I aIntro -- Contents -- Introduction: Entrepreneurs Are Different -- Chapter One: The Thumb: Strength of Character -- Turning Bad Luck into Good Luck -- If It Weren't for Bad Luck -- Distilling It Down -- Points to Remember | Things to Do -- Chapter Two: The Index Finger: F.O.C.U.S. -- Focus in Battle, in Business, in Life -- The Power of Unrelenting Focus -- Distilling It Down -- Points to Remember | Things to Do -- Chapter Three: The Middle FInger: Brand -- Are You a Rolex-or a Fake Rolex? -- What's in a Name? -- Distilling It Down -- Points to Remember | Things to Do -- Chapter Four: The Ring Finger: Relationships -- The Perils of Partnerships -- Strong Relationships Are the Key -- Distilling It Down -- Points to Remember |Things to Do -- Chapter Five: The Little Finger: Little Things That Count -- Little Things Are Big Things -- Luxury and Details -- Distilling It Down -- Points to Remember | Things to Do -- Afterword.017L aGBV_ILN_617017L aISIL_DE-Hv137017L aGBV_ILN_2148017L aISIL_DE-950
